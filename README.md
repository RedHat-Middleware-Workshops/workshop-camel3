# A Day In the Life of a Camel developer

## Camel 3 Workshop

This workshop presents an exciting real-world base scenario, where you will impersonate the regular _Kubernetes_ user as well as the experienced _Camel_ developer.

You will complete a series of exercises, ranging from simple data flows to medium and advanced use cases, fully event driven with daily data-backup processing enabled with Red Hat's Data Foundation.

The lab is very easy to follow and delivers great value on each step the student completes.
