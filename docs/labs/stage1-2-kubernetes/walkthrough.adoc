// = Lab 1 - Matrix to Rocket.Chat bridge (part-2, Kubernetes user)
= Lab 1.path2 - MessageHub - Be the Kubernetes user

// = [[kubernetes-user]] The Kubernetes user deployment flow

Impersonate the Kubernetes user to complete Lab-1's Matrix to Rocket.Chat processing flow.

In this second part, the instructions will guide you in defining a _Kamelet Binding_ that enables the data flow, and pushing it to the _OpenShift_ environment where it becomes live.

Technical goals and milestones:

* Creation process of a _no-code_ integration (_Kamelet_ binding)
* Define JSON data transformers.
* Deployment in OpenShift

[time=10]
[id="main"]
== Bridge definition and deployment 

For reference, here's again the processing flow to implement:

image::images/processing-flow.png[align="center", width=80%]

You will include 3 Kamelets:

====
* *A source* +
Consumes events from _Matrix_.

* *An action* +
Transforms _Matrix_ events to _Rocket.Chat_ events (in JSON format).

* *A sink* +
Produces events to _Rocket.Chat_.
====

{empty} +

[IMPORTANT] 
--
You need to already be onboarded into _Matrix_ and _Rocket.Chat_. +
Ensure you have previously completed: 

- *_Lab 1.intro - MessageHub - Scenario and Onboarding_*.
--

{empty} +

The instructions below will make you progress one _Camel_ step at a time rather than providing a complete _Kamelet Binding_ of the full data flow. This will allow you to play with different _Kamelets_ and understand better the mechanics of _Kamelet Bindings_.

. Create a folder and resources where you will work
+
For example:
+
[source, subs=]
----
mkdir lab1
cd lab1
touch g2s.yaml
touch stage1.properties<br>
----
+
NOTE: The commands above also create the file sources you need for the exercise.
+
{empty} +

. Create the definitions

.. Open the `g2s.yaml` file in your editor.
+
Select from your project tree:
+
* MessageHub -> Lab1 -> g2s.yaml
+
image::images/crw-open-yaml.png[align="left", width=50%]
+
{empty} +

.. To start with, we will simply consume Matrix messages and log them. We select the following 2 Kamelets to bind:
+
--
- matrix-source
- log-sink
--
+
NOTE: The `matrix-source` _Kamelet_ is not provided out of the box by Camel K. It has been specifically created and deployed for this workshop.
+
{empty} +
+
Include in your YAML file `g2s.yaml` (matrix to rocketchat) the following definition:
+
```yaml
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: g2s
  annotations:
    trait.camel.apache.org/mount.configs: "secret:stage1"

spec:

  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: matrix-source
    properties:
      token: "{{matrix.token}}"
      room:  "{{matrix.room}}"

  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: log-sink 
```
+
{empty} +

.. Now include in your properties file `stage1.properties` the following entries:
+
```properties
# Matrix credentials
matrix.token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
matrix.room=YOUR_ROOM_ID
```
+
{empty} +
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure you replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `YOUR_ROOM_ID` with the values you obtained from the _Matrix_ onboarding process.
====
+
NOTE: The `matrix-source` kamelet is implemented following the specification of the Matrix Sync API (new Matrix's API) to consume events from the server. To know more, read its API documentation here: https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#syncing
+
{empty} +

. Push the configuration to _OpenShift_
+
If you didn't log in yet to _OpenShift_, run the following command:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc login -u {user-username} -p {user-password} https://$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST:$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
----
+
Make sure the _working_ project in _OpenShift_ is selected by executing the following command:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc project {namespace}
----
+
{empty} +
+
Then create a _Secret_ containing your configuration. Run the following `oc` command:
+
```bash
oc create secret generic stage1 --from-file=stage1.properties
```
{empty} +

. Deploy your YAML definition containing your Kamelet Binding
.. Run the following `oc` command to deploy the integration:
+
```bash
oc apply -f g2s.yaml
```
+
{empty} +
+
The Camel K operator will immediately react. It will start building the integration and deploy it.
+
NOTE: Be patient, this action may take some time to complete. If the flow was previously built by other students, it will only take a minute. If not, the operator needs to download all the maven dependencies, build the application and create the image before the integration can be deployed (could take up to 10mn the first time).
+
{empty} +
+
You can monitor the state of the resource with the following command:
+
```bash
oc get klb -w
```
+
TIP: the argument `klb` stands for _Kamelet Binding_.
+
During the time you see _Camel K_ building and deploying the integration, the output for the command above should show something similar to:
+
----
NAME   PHASE      REPLICAS
g2s    Creating   
g2s    Ready      0
g2s    Ready      1
g2s    Ready      1
----
+
{blank}
+
The last entry indicates the pod is ready.
+
{empty} +

.. Check your deployment
+
Inspect in your link:{openshift-host}/topology/ns/{namespace}[OpenShift Developer view, window="_blank"] your pod is in healthy state and running:
+
image::images/ocp-dev-pod-healthy.png[align="left", width=80%]
+
TIP: You can zoom in/out the canvas by using your mouse scrolling function, and move it around by clicking and dragging the background.
+
{empty} +
+
NOTE: You will observe your project also includes a pre-deployed _AMQ Streams (Kafka)_ cluster. Later in the workshop, you will use this dedicated _Kafka_ cluster to stream data in and out.
+
{empty} +

.. Check the logs.
+
You can open the logs of the _Camel_ instance by:
+
--
. Clicking in the pod's icon
. From the right pane, click `Resources`
. Click `View logs`
--
+
{blank}
+
image::images/ocp-dev-pod-logs.png[align="left", width=90%]
+
{blank}
+
You should see Camel connecting to Matrix and wait for the stream to start:
+
----
... : Apache Camel 3.14.2.redhat-00047 (camel-1) started in 825ms (build:0ms init:708ms start:117ms)
...
... : Opening connection to Matrix...
... : Matrix HTTP Streaming started
----
+
{empty} +

. Send a message from _Matrix_
+
Now, from _Matrix_'s chat room, send a message, for example `Hello Camel`.
+
image::images/gitter-send-message.png[align="left", width=60%]
+
{blank}
+
The logs in your pod should show the arrival of a _Matrix_ event similar to the following JSON payload:
+
----
{"fromUser":{"username":"bmesegue","displayName":"bmesegue"},"text":"Hello Camel","sent":"2023-02-21T10:15:17.000Z"}
----
+
CAUTION: If your terminal does not log JSON events (as above), you might be sending messages from the _Matrix_ server instead of the _Matrix_ server. Ensure you connect to the _Matrix_ server when you login to the platform from your browser. Follow carefully the instructions in the section *Matrix platform onboarding* where the login process is described in detail.
+
{blank}
+
{empty} +
+
Hopefully you've been successful in capturing _Matrix_ messages with _Camel_. 
+
{empty} +

. Now we need to extend the _Kamelet Binding_ definition to include data transformation matching the JSON structure the target system (Rocket.Chat) expects.
+
We choose from the Kamelet Catalog the JSLT action to transform the body.
+
TIP: JSLT is a very convenient transformer to manipulate JSON payloads. It's inspired in XSLT (XML Transformation) to define stylesheets containing transformation rules for JSON.
+
.. Create the JSLT file `g2s.jslt` using the command:
+
```bash
touch g2s.jslt
```
+
{empty} +

.. Open it in your editor and paste the following definition:
+
```
{
    "channel":"TO_BE_DEFINED",
    "text":"*"+.fromUser.username+"@matrix*: "+.text
}
```
+
[NOTE]
====
* The field `channel` denotes the target room in _Rocket.Chat_ where messages will be pushed. For now we use a temporary value. +
* The field `text` includes JsonPath rules extracting values from the input _Matrix_ event.
====
{empty} +

.. Now, let's push the JSLT transformation as a _ConfigMap_ resource the Kamelet Binding will use.
+
Run the following `oc` command:
+
```bash
oc create cm stage1-transform --from-file=g2s.jslt
```
{empty} +

. Modify your YAML definition.
+
Include the following pieces of definitions:
+
--
* the trait to mount your _ConfigMap_
* the JSLT action between your _Kamelet_ source and sink.
--
+
{blank}
+
NOTE: The JSLT action is defined as a step in a _KameletBinding_ definition. `steps` are a high-level block in the same column as the `source` and `sink`.
+
[TIP]
--
For clarity, the picture below illustrates how copy/paste actions  should be performed all along the lab exercises.

image::images/crw-copy-paste.png[align="left", width=100%]
--
+
Following the above illustration, copy and paste the snippets from below into your code:
+
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: g2s
  annotations:
    trait.camel.apache.org/mount.configs: "secret:stage1"
----
+
```yaml
    trait.camel.apache.org/mount.resources: "configmap:stage1-transform"
```
+
----
spec:

  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: matrix-source
    properties:
      token: "{{matrix.token}}"
      room:  "{{matrix.room}}"
----
+
```yaml
  steps:
  - ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: jslt-action
    properties:
      template: g2s.jslt
```
+
----
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: log-sink 
----
+
{empty} +
+


. Redeploy your YAML definition by running again:
+
```bash
oc apply -f g2s.yaml
```
+
{empty} +
+
The Camel K operator needs again to download dependencies (JSLT), but after some time it will replace the pod with a new instance containing the data transformation.
+
IMPORTANT: The old version will keep running until _Camel K_ finishes building and deploying the new version. Make sure you wait until the new version has been rolled out.
+
You can monitor the state of the deployment with the following command:
+
```bash
oc get klb -w
```
+
{blank}
+
During the time you see _Camel K_ building and deploying the new version, the output for the command above should show something similar to:
+
----
NAME   PHASE      REPLICAS
g2s    Creating 
g2s    Ready      2
g2s    Ready      1
----
+
{blank}
+
The first entry indicates the new version is being rollet out (while the previous version still is running) and the second entry indicates the roll out has concluded.
+
As per the picture below, in your console's topology view you will see a new pod being rolled out:
+
image::images/ocp-dev-pod-new-version.png[align="left", width=40%]
+
{empty} +
+

. Send test message
+
When the new pod is ready, from _Matrix_ send another chat message and inspect your terminal output. +
You should see an incoming event now transformed and looking similar to this:
+
----
{"channel":"TO_BE_DEFINED","text":"*bmesegue@matrix*: Hello Camel"}
----
+
{empty} +
+
At this stage you're ready to replace the `log-sink` kamelet by the real one, the `rocketchat-sink` kamelet.
+
{empty} +

. [[step-rocketchat-sink]]Replace your _Log_ sink _Kamelet_ by the _Rocket.Chat_ one.
+
Copy from below the `rocketchat-sink` definition, and replace your old `log-sink` code.
+

    properties:
      token: "{{rocketchat.token}}"
```
+
{blank}
+
[TIP]
--
If you want to keep the `log-sink` activity, you can move it to the `steps` group as an action using the following definition:

----
  - ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: log-sink   
----

+
{empty} +

. Configure your target Rocket.Chat `channel`
+
Previously we defined a dummy value in our JSLT transformation (where the `channel` field is defined). Now we need to replace the dummy value with the real one.
+
.. Open in Rocket.Chat the room details
+
image::images/slack-room-details.png[align="left", width=20%]
+
{empty} +

.. Copy the Channel ID at the bottom of the details frame
+
image::images/slack-room-details-channel-id.png[align="left", width=30%]
+
{empty} +

.. Paste its value in your JSLT mapping. It should you similar to the following:
+
```
{
    "channel":"C04QBN33NUW",
    "text":"*"+.fromUser.username+"@matrix*: "+.text
}
```
+
IMPORTANT: The above `channel` is an example, make sure you replace `C04QBN33NUW` with your _Channel ID_.
+
{empty} +
+
Rocket.Chat will read the `channel` field (target room), from the JSON payload we send, to know where to place the message. +
+
{empty} +
.. Update your _ConfigMap_ by running:
+
[source, subs=]
----
oc delete cm stage1-transform
oc create cm stage1-transform --from-file=g2s.jslt
<br>
----
{empty} +

. Include your _Rocket.Chat_ token in your configuration file.
+
.. Copy from below the parameter definition `rocketchat.token`, paste it into your properties file, and configure its value with your Rocket.Chat access token value.
+
----
# Matrix credentials
matrix.token=2d482bdf092e0e2299832b1f38d9560243083894
matrix.room=6317569e6da03739849c519a
----
+
```properties
# Rocket.Chat 
# Credentials
rocketchat.token=YOUR_TOKEN
```
+
{empty} +
+
Obtain the _Rocket.Chat_ token with 1 of these 3 options, and replace `YOUR_TOKEN`:
+
* *Option 1*: Try the link below:
+
--
WARNING: The link may fail if the cluster did not enable token resolution. +
If it fails, choose [*Option 2*] or [*Option 3*].
--
+
- link:{invite-url}/token/rocketchat[Obtain _Rocket.Chat_ token,window="_blank"]
+
{empty} +

* *Option 2*: if you're sharing an App with the group, use the App's token your admin has provided.
* *Option 3*: if you created your own App, use your App's `Bot User OAuth Token`
+
{empty} +
.. Update your _Secret_ by running:
+
[source, subs=]
----
oc delete secret stage1
oc create secret generic stage1 --from-file=stage1.properties
<br>
----
{empty} +

. Redeploy your Kamelet Binding:
+
```bash
oc apply -f g2s.yaml
```
+
{empty} +
+
Once more the _Camel K_ operator will rebuild the integration and replace the pod with a new instance that points to _Rocket.Chat_.
+
IMPORTANT: The old version will keep running until _Camel K_ finishes building and deploying the new version. Make sure you wait until the new version has been rolled out.
+
{empty} +

. One more time, from Matrix send one last message. If all goes well you should see the message listed in your Rocket.Chat chat window
+
image::images/stage1-msg-gitter-slack.png[align="left", width=80%]
+
{empty} +


[type=verification]
Did you see the message going from _Matrix_ showing to _Rocket.Chat_?
