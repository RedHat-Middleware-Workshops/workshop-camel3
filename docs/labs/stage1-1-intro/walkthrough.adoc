=== User profiles

This workshop has been designed to attend two different user profiles:


* *The Kubernetes user* (no previous Camel experience) +
The way this user consumes _Camel_ is by selecting catalog _Kamelets_ and creating _Kamelet Bindings_ in YAML definitions. The user creates local YAML files and then pushes them to _OpenShift_. The _Camel K_ operator automates the process of building, creating images and deploying the integrations.

* *The Camel developer* +
The traditional _Camel_ developer would typically, first, use his local environment for the inner loop development cycle. This strategy allows speeding up the process of prototyping and validating the code. Once the basics covered, it would follow the same deployment flow as the Kubernetes user.

== Scenario introduction

The picture billow illustrates the data flow traversing our Camel instance:

image::images/data-flow.png[align="center", width=80%]

The above process bridges chat messages from _Gitter_ to _Slack_. It requires enabling access to both chat platforms.

Both _Gitter_ and _Slack_ are independent instant messaging systems. _Gitter_ is designed to be a developer collaboration tool while _Slack_ is more generic and aims to be the platform of choice for the entire office. They both have convenient online web access making them ideal for students to use in this workshop.

The tasks to complete in this lab will guide you on how to onboard to both chat systems.

[id="gitter-chat"]
== Gitter platform onboarding

TIP: If you're unfamiliar with Gitter, it is an open-source chat platform designed for developers to have a space where to collaborate and discuss project topics.

{empty} +

=== Create an App in Gitter.





. Login in Gitter
+
You can use one of the following accounts to join Gitter:
+
--
* GitHub
* GitLab
* Twitter
--
+
{empty} +
+
Login to Gitter's developer portal following the URL below: + 
https://developer.gitter.im/login
+
Once logged in, you'll be presented with your personal access token and an empty list of apps (if never created one before).
+
image::images/gitter-dev-token.png[align="left", width=30%,border-color="green", border-width="2"]
+
{empty} +

. Create a new App that will communicate with Gitter:

1. Click `Your Apps -> New app`
+
1. Give it a new name and set `\http://localhost:8080` as `Redirect URL`. +
For example:
+
--
* *Name*: +
`camelbot`
* *Redirect URL*: +
`\http://localhost:8080`
--
+
{empty} +
+
Gitter will generate your App's access credentials, for example:
+
image::images/gitter-dev-new-app.png[align="left", width=40%,border-color="green", border-width="3"]
+
{empty} +

=== Authorise your App.

. We need to complete the OAuth web authentication flow.
+
[NOTE]
--
For reference, here's the specification describing the authentication flow:

* https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-4.1 
--
+
.. Compose the following URL call:
+
CAUTION: ensure you replace `YOUR_APP_OAUTH_KEY`
+
```http
https://gitter.im/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_APP_OAUTH_KEY&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080
```
+
{empty} +
+
For example:
+
* `\https://gitter.im/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=4b03ca9d94d128f1a219027b776722059cc89bba&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080`
+
{empty} +

.. Open a browser tab, enter your URL in the address bar and press enter. The browser will load an authorization page as per the picture below:
+
image::images/gitter-dev-new-app-approve.png[align="left", width=30%,border-color="green", border-width="3"]
+
{empty} +
+
Click `ALLOW`.
+
The approval action will trigger a redirect that will cause a browser connection error since we we're not running a listening app on 8080, but it allows us to obtain the returned authorisation code from the address bar that should be similar to the following:
+
- \http://localhost:8080/?code=`0119b1eb4d69eb1c2bcf3c9a0570a711cd4b038b`
+
{empty} +

.. Take note of the code, now we have to exchange it to obtain an access token. +
Use the following cURL base command:
+
CAUTION: ensure you replace `YOUR_APP_OAUTH_KEY` / `YOUR_APP_OAUTH_SECRET` / `YOUR_REDIRECT_CODE`
+
```curl
CLIENT_ID=YOUR_APP_OAUTH_KEY \
CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_APP_OAUTH_SECRET \
CODE=YOUR_REDIRECT_CODE \
&& \
curl -v https://gitter.im/login/oauth/token \
-H "accept: application/json" \
-d "client_id="$CLIENT_ID"&client_secret="$CLIENT_SECRET"&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080&grant_type=authorization_code&code="$CODE
```
+
{empty} +
+
For example:
+
----
CLIENT_ID=4b03ca9d94d128f1a219027b776722059cc89bba \
CLIENT_SECRET=8306c0803f4c15319ed20e436870515b8660bad4 \
CODE=0119b1eb4d69eb1c2bcf3c9a0570a711cd4b038b \
&& \
curl -v https://gitter.im/login/oauth/token \
-H "accept: application/json" \
-d "client_id="$CLIENT_ID"&client_secret="$CLIENT_SECRET"&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080&grant_type=authorization_code&code="$CODE
----
+
{empty} +
+
This above cURL command should return something like:
+
----
{"access_token":"2d482bdf092e0e2299832b1f38d9560243083894","token_type":"Bearer"}
----
+
{empty} +

.. Now, use the returned token to discover available Room IDs. Use the following base command:
+
CAUTION: ensure you replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`
+
```curl
TOKEN=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN \
&& \
curl -v https://api.gitter.im/v1/rooms \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer "$TOKEN
```
+
{empty} +
+
For example:
+
----
TOKEN=2d482bdf092e0e2299832b1f38d9560243083894 \
&& \
curl -v https://api.gitter.im/v1/rooms \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer "$TOKEN
----
+
{empty} +
+
The command above will probably return an empty list if you have not yet joined any _Gitter_ room.

{empty} +

=== Join a Gitter room.

. A number of public rooms were made available for this workshop (roomX). Choose a room number that nobody uses to avoid noisy conversations. Use the invite URL below to join the lab room:
+
CAUTION: ensure you replace `YOUR_ROOM`
+
```http
https://gitter.im/test-lab-camel/YOUR_ROOM?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link
```
+
{empty} +
+
For example, if choosing `room1`, use the following invite URL
+
----
https://gitter.im/test-lab-camel/room1?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link
----
+
{empty} +
+
Click `JOIN ROOM` at the bottom of the chat room. At this point you see your avatar included in the room on the right hand side of the room.
+
Running the cURL command again to obtain the rooms should return the identifier of the room you just joined, something similar to:
+
----
[{"id":"6317569e6da03739849c519a"         }]
----
+
{empty} +
+
At this stage, you should have available all the configuration identifiers to define the Kamelet Binding in the next section using the following:
+
```properties
# Gitter credentials
gitter.token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
gitter.room=YOUR_ROOM_ID
```
+
{empty} +
+
For example
+
----
# Gitter credentials
gitter.token=2d482bdf092e0e2299832b1f38d9560243083894
gitter.room=6317569e6da03739849c519a

== Development environment

The following instructions introduce you to your development environment, and the cluster where you'll deploy your applications throughout this workshop.

=== Overview

Built on the open Eclipse Che project, Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces uses Kubernetes and containers to provide any member of the development or IT team with a consistent, secure, and zero-configuration development environment. The experience is as fast and familiar as an integrated development environment on your laptop.

OpenShift Dev Spaces is included with your OpenShift subscription and is available in the Operator Hub. It provides development teams a faster and more reliable foundation on which to work, and it gives operations centralized control and peace of mind.

[NOTE]
====
This IDE is based on *CodeReady*, which is in turn is based on Microsoft VSCode. It will look familiar if you have already used it.

You can close the _Problems_ and _Output_ views to clear space.
====

=== Accessing a Terminal

During the workshop you will use the OpenShift CLI along with other developer-focused Command Line Interface (CLI) tools.
These CLI tools are available directly inside your Workspace via tools containers.

Access the tools container(s) like so:

. Click on the _My Workspace_ (cube) icon on the right side panel.
. Expand the *User Runtimes* folder.
. Expand the *tools* section.
. Click on *>_ New terminal*.

{blank}

A terminal window should be open at the bottom of the screen. This terminal is attached to the running CodeReady container and is also running on OpenShift. This is the place where you will issue most of the commands from this workshop.

image::images/02-crw-tools-container.png[Open Terminal, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

=== Login into OpenShift using the CLI

. Open a terminal using the instructions from the previous section.
. In the terminal tab, issue the following command:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc login -u {user-username} -p {user-password} https://$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST:$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true

== Preview of the integration flow

=== Process overview

The diagram below illustrates the processing flow you're about to create:

image::images/processing-flow.png[align="center", width=80%]

There are 3 Kamelets in use:

====
* *A source* +
Consumes events from _Gitter_.

* *An action* +
Transforms _Gitter_ events to _Slack_ events (in JSON format).

* *A sink* +
Produces events to _Slack_.
====


{empty} +

=== User profiles

This workshop has been designed to attend two different user profiles:


* *The Kubernetes user* (no previous Camel experience) +
The way this user consumes _Camel_ is by selecting catalog _Kamelets_ and creating _Kamelet Bindings_ in YAML definitions. The user creates local YAML files and then pushes them to _OpenShift_. The _Camel K_ operator automates the process of building, creating images and deploying the integrations.

* *The Camel developer* +
The traditional _Camel_ developer would typically, first, use his local environment for the inner loop development cycle. This strategy allows speeding up the process of prototyping and validating the code. Once the basics covered, it would follow the same deployment flow as the Kubernetes user.
+
{empty} +
+
NOTE: The YAML definitions are identical for both profiles. Although this first lab is targeted for the Kubernetes user, we also want to introduce how the Camel developer uses development tooling to accelerate the creation process.

{empty} +

It's up to you to choose which user to impersonate. Considering how easy are the instructions to follow, we recommend choosing the Camel developer, which will anyway mimic the Kubernetes user when deploying in OpenShift. However, if time is a constraint then choose the Kubernetes user.

You've reached the end of Part 1. To complete Lab 1, choose from the main dashboard part 2, it can either be the Camel developer, or the Kubernetes user as per the picture below:
